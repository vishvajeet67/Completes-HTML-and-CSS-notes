            <h2>History of WWW</h2>
            <p class="buff"><br>
                <div> World Wide Web (WWW) was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN, a research organization in Switzerland. He developed it as a way for scientists to easily share information across different computers. The first website went live in 1991, providing basic information about the WWW. Since then, the WWW has grown into a vast network of interconnected webpages, serving as a hub for communication, research, entertainment, and much more. Its development has revolutionized how we access and share information globally.</div>

            <h2>Evolution of HTML</h2>
            <p class="buff"><br>
                <div><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s. Here's a brief overview of its evolution:</b></div>
                <ol class="buff"><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 1.0 (1991):</b> This was the first version of HTML, primarily focused on structuring text documents with basic elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It introduced the concept of hyperlinks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 2.0 (1995):</b> This version added features like tables, forms, and image support. It also introduced the &lt;meta&gt; tag for specifying metadata about the document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 3.2 (1997):</b> This version standardized many features that were previously only supported by certain browsers. It introduced support for frames, scripting, and improved table capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 4.01 (1999):</b> HTML 4.01 refined and extended the features introduced in previous versions. It added support for style sheets (CSS), scripting with JavaScript, and introduced more semantic elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>XHTML (2000):</b> XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML syntax. It aimed to make HTML more compatible with XML and to enforce stricter syntax rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML5 (2014):</b> HTML5 brought significant changes and improvements to HTML. It introduced new semantic elements (e.g., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;), native support for multimedia elements (audio, video), canvas for graphics, and support for offline web applications. It also included APIs for geolocation, drag and drop, and web storage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML Living Standard (Ongoing):</b> Instead of releasing new versions, HTML is now maintained as a "living standard," continuously evolving with new features and improvements. Browser vendors implement features as they become standardized, leading to a more dynamic development process.HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands of modern web development, with ongoing efforts to improve accessibility, performance, and flexibility.

			<h2>HTML5 New Features</h2>
			<p class="buff"><br>
				<div><b>HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements to enhance web development capabilities. Here are some of the key features: </b></div>
				<ul class="buff"><br>
					<li>
						<b>Semantic Elements</b>: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;. These elements help developers structure web pages more meaningfully, making them more accessible to both users and search engines.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Audio and Video Support</b>: HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages using the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements. This eliminated the need for third-party plugins like Flash and improved performance and accessibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Canvas</b>: HTML5 introduced the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which provides a drawing surface for creating dynamic graphics and animations using JavaScript. This feature opened up new possibilities for interactive web applications and games.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Form Enhancements</b>: HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., email, url, date, color) and attributes (e.g., autofocus, placeholder, required) to improve form handling and validation. This made it easier for developers to create user-friendly and accessible web forms.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Local Storage</b>: HTML5 introduced APIs for storing data locally on the user's device, including localStorage and sessionStorage. This enabled developers to create offline web applications and improve performance by caching data locally.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Geolocation API</b>: HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access the user's location information (with their permission). This feature is useful for location-based services and applications.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Web Workers</b>: HTML5 introduced the concept of Web Workers, which are background scripts that run independently of the main browser thread. This enables developers to perform tasks like complex calculations or data processing without affecting the responsiveness of the user interface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Web Storage</b>: HTML5 introduced sessionStorage and localStorage, which allow developers to store data on the client-side browser. This enables web applications to store data locally and access it across sessions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Responsive Images</b>: HTML5 introduced the &lt;picture&gt; element and the srcset attribute, which allow developers to provide multiple versions of an image based on factors like screen size and resolution. This helps optimize image delivery for different devices and screen sizes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>WebRTC</b>: HTML5 introduced the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) API, which enables real-time communication between web browsers without the need for plugins. This includes features like video chat, voice calling, and peer-to-peer file sharing.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Browsers support</h2>
			<p><br>
				<div><b>Browser support for HTML5 features:</b></div>
				<ul class="buff"><br>
					<li>
						Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari generally have good support for HTML5 features.
					</li>
					<li>
						Microsoft Edge is improving but may lag behind in some areas.
					</li>
					<li>
						Internet Explorer has limited support for HTML5, especially in older versions.
					</li>
					<li>
